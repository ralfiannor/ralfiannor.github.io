My name is Rizal Alfiannor (24th), a web developer focused on Backend Developer.  I started from making a website only with HTML and bot scripts for fun since 2010. Then focus as a Backend Developer when I begin my professional career. Javascript (NodeJS) and PHP is my favorite language as a Backend Developer. 

> Backend Developer consists of three parts that a user never sees: a server, an application, and a database.


### Server and Networking

I was once a participant in a student vocational competition to represent my district area, and that's I began to many studies about server and networking. In cloud technology, I'm used to using **Google Cloud Platform**.

### Programming Language
I worked with PHP for 3 years, before I began my professional career. Since April 2018, I went to Bekasi, West Java to start my professional career and move to Javascript (NodeJS) as a server side programming language. Now, micro service architecture has been used by many people in the world, I always like any programming language as long as it can solve the problem.

### Contact Me
If you see this web, that's my reason for sharing anything that I like in the world. You can find me on almost social media. I always open anything questions for me and suggest to contact me on **facebook** except you want to contact me for the business you can find me on **Linkedin** or **Email**.
